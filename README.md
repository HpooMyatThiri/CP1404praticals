# Practical Assignments

## Overview

This repository comprises my solutions and code for the practical assignments in CP1404.

## About Me

I'm Hpoo Myat Thiri, a student currently pursuing my studies at JamesCook University. This repository showcases my efforts in CP1404, where I apply programming concepts to practical assignments.

## Clean Code Insights

1. **Uniform Naming:** Ensured that variable and function names are descriptive and adhere to a consistent naming convention throughout the codebase.

2. **Modular Design:** Organized functionality into distinct functions and classes, following the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) to enhance code readability and maintainability.

3. **Informative Comments:** Provided clear and concise comments to elucidate intricate sections of code, facilitating comprehension for others (or my future self) regarding the purpose and functionality.
